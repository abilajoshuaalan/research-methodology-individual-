[4]Ever since Google Docs was rebranded as Google Drive, we've found a bit of explanation is in order regarding the name. Google Drive is the whole shebang. It comprises Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides, or at least it works very tightly with them. The issue of separate apps gets confusing when it comes to the mobile version of Google Drive, but online it's much clearer. Google Drive and its apps work basically the same way Microsoft OneDrive does with the online versions of Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. we don't strictly consider Google Drive an online backup solution, saving files to it can serve as a sort of backup as well as merely a way to access the files.Compatibility is rarely an issue you can upload files, convert them to Google's file format to edit them online or create new documents, spreadsheets, and slide presentations in the Web interfac, export finished products to standard file formats, such as doc, rtf, pdf, and so on. With the recently introduced Microsoft Office plugin for Google Drive, you can now use your Google Drive as storage for files you edit with the installed Microsoft Office apps, removing any chance of incompatibility.

[5]Google Drive is a cloud storage service, and like any cloud storage service its main purpose is to expand your ability to store files beyond the limits of your hard drive. Cloud storage is sometimes confused with online backup, which achieves a very different purpose using similar infrastructure. However, simply put, online backup is designed to replicate your hard drive rather than expand it, with the goal of disaster recovery. As we’ll mention later, Google Drive has recently started to expand into the online backup market by letting you tag any folder for backup.Google will give you 15GB of free cloud storage just for signing up. However, it’s important to realize that all of that free space is shared between Google Drive, Google Photos and Gmail
\paragraph{•}
[6]Google Drive is increasingly the backbone of Google’s cloud-based services, now providing 15GB of pooled storage for your Gmail inbox, Google Drive files and documents and your Google+ Photos, absolutely free.Higher capacity plans are available, starting at 4.99 per month for 100GB and stretching all the way up to 799.99 per month for a massive 16TB.The last eighteen months have seen some big improvements.
\paragraph {•}
[6]You can now share files with a right-click from within the Google Drive folder, while the system tray applet provides more options and information than it used to.where the online Google Drive used to be a struggle to navigate,now offers a more intuitive grid-based view, which makes it easy to browse files, particularly PDFs, PowerPoint files or photos.Google Drive’s biggest advantage has always been its integration with Google’s other products and services.The mobile Google Drive apps extremely ease upload of files from device to Google Drive. Google Drive support is also being built into more apps, not just Android apps like Google’s own QuickOffice, but Chrome and Chrome OS apps as well. Plus, it’s quick and easy to preview office documents, PDFs and most common photo and video file formats straight from the Web, whether you have any specific software installed or not.
